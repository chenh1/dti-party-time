dti-party-time
==============

Javascript function which calculates approximate debt to income ratio to get an idea of loan pre-qualification chances for a potential home buyer, monthly mortgage payments, and other grown-up stuff. Plug in the following:

1. Prospective home's sale price 
2. The loan amount you plan on taking
3. The current approximate interest rate (California's is currently about 4.1%)
4. Term of the loan in years (30 year mortgage, etc) 
5. HOA fees if applicable 
6. Your estimated monthly liabilities (existing mortgage, car loan/lease, medical debt) 
7. Your estimated monthly income.

Note: Property tax is based on California's approximate average.

Disclaimer: The calculator is only an approximation. Please don't run to your local bank with this to show that you prequalify for a home loan just because the calculator says your DTI is under 40% or something.
